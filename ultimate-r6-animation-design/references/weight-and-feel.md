# Weight and feel on R6

How to make six blocks feel heavy, snappy and smooth instead of plastic. Every number names its
source (details in `sources.md`). Numbers are starting points to vary, not laws. Only the four
non-negotiables in SKILL.md hold everywhere.

## 1. Why R6 reads as plastic

Mostly from DevForum critiques of R6 combat animation:
- **Even spacing and linear keys.** Every in-between moves the same amount, so nothing accelerates.
- **Twinning.** Left and right do the same thing at the same time.
- **Everything moves at once.** No part leads and no part drags.
- **A strike that slows at the end.** It reads as touching air instead of hitting.
- **Cutting out of a move.** No follow-through, or straight back to the start pose.
- **A dead idle.** The pose is held at zero motion.
- **Sliding feet.** The root drifts over planted feet, or the feet ride the torso's twist.
- **Tucked-in limbs, or limbs thrown off the body.** An arm locked in its socket stops every punch
  short and reads timid (the user's complaint about the IK version). An arm thrown 2-4 studs out
  (some Toolbox packs) reads as a broken rig. Slide limbs a short way: `posing.md` section 3.
- **A body that does not commit.** The fist moves, the torso barely turns. R6 punch references
  turn the torso 30-110 degrees and lunge 0.2-0.65 stud.
- **Punches on the wrong line.** Aimed at shoulder height instead of the target's centre line.
- **Travel inside the clip.** An animation that carries the body far, or keys HumanoidRootPart.

R6 has fewer joints than a human, so it needs *more* exaggeration than feels natural (Sakurai via
the motion bible; DevForum "exaggerate more on rigs with few joints").

## 2. Timing

**Short before the hit, long after.** The hit lands at a third to a fifth of the move (Sakurai).
The starter kit lands at 29–34%. Creator Store R6 punch packs land later, around 50%, and carry
the weight in the recovery instead of a hold; use that for single heavy moves, the earlier hit for
a chained M1 string.

| Move (60 fps) | Total | Load | Strike | Hit at | Hold | Recovery | Hit-stop |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jab (power) | 30 f (0.5 s) | 4 f + 3 f hang | 3 f | f10 (33%) | 8 f | 12 f, snaps | 75 ms |
| Cross | 32 f | 4 f + 3 f hang | 4 f | f11 (34%) | 8 f | 13 f | 80 ms |
| Hook | 32 f | 5 f + 3 f hang | 4 f | f12 (38%) | 7 f | 13 f | 85 ms |
| Uppercut | 38 f | 6 f + 3 f hang | 4 f | f13 (34%) | 8 f | 17 f | 120 ms |
| Push kick | 40 f | 6 f | 6 f | f12 (30%) | 8 f | 20 f | 100 ms |
| Dash forward | 26 f | 3 f crouch | 3 f burst | Go at f6 | glide to f14 | 12 f brake | none |

Rules behind the table:
- **A key needs 4–6 frames on screen to read** (2017 GDC panel, via the motion bible). Hold the
  contact pose that long.
- **The chamber-to-contact strike is 3–5 frames.** In the Nullscript fight (YouTube) a punch goes
  from chamber to contact in about 3 frames and holds the extended arm about 6 frames or more.
- **Make a move shorter, never faster.** Cut holds, settles and recovery, never the strike (2018
  panel, Skullgirls).
- **Combo spacing.** One DevForum combo spaced its punches 0.41 s apart and they read well; at
  0.35 s they blended into each other. The kit's cancel windows open at 0.2–0.4 s.
- **A string builds.** The first hit is fast, later hits are heavier, and the finisher is the
  heaviest: deeper chamber, longer hit-stop (motion bible). Jab 60 ms → Uppercut 120 ms.
- **A player move changes pose on its first frame.** A press must read as taken at once (motion
  bible). Light jabs have near-zero chambers and heavy hits get a real one.

### Power comes from contrast (the "hang, then snap" recipe)

Two references show what makes a light punch hit hard, and the kit's Jab now follows them:
- **"cross punch"** (YouTube Shorts `X1SlPWUjW3k`, creator wesley, Moon Animator). At 30 fps:
  - the chamber holds 4–5 frames with a slight creep
  - the release takes 1–2 frames
  - an impact cone flashes at contact
  - the torso keeps turning about 0.2 s with swing arcs
  - the extension holds about 0.3 s
  - the arm snaps back to guard in 2 frames
- **A YouTube combat-system showcase**, M1s at 30 fps:
  - a 2-frame wind-up flash (a Highlight)
  - a 3–4 frame strike, with the whole body diving about 40° forward behind the arm
  - about 3 frames held at contact
  - M1s about 0.63 s apart, with random variants per hit

The recipe, in frames at 60 fps:
1. **Load and strain (4–6 frames).** Sit back, square up a little, draw the fist in, and keep
   loading through the hold. A frozen chamber reads as a stall.
2. **Release in 2–3 frames,** with the `snap` ease and the audit's `strike` window covering it.
   The slower the load, the harder a short release reads.
3. **The whole body behind the fist:**
   - lean 20–28° and lunge 0.4–0.6 stud
   - the torso turns 45–60° into the punch (jab: twist toward −50; cross: toward +60)
   - **the shoulder is thrown 0.6–0.9 stud out of its socket** along the punch line (`pos.forward`
     on the arm): the fist ends 3+ studs in front of the root, like the R6 punch packs
   - the front leg steps and the back leg extends, both hung from the pelvis (`posing.md` §4)
   - **the rear hand yanks back** to the chin as the lead fires (action and reaction)
4. **Arrive with a lurch.** `{ settle = 0.12 }` leaving contact, so the body passes the pose a hair
   and comes back.
5. **Hold 6–10 frames, creeping in.** This is what the eye keeps, and hit-stop sits on top of it.
6. **Snap home.** Return to guard over 6–8 frames with `snap`, then a short settle. Do not drift
   back slowly: a slow return gives the power away.
7. **Telegraph and juice.** A wind-up highlight for the chamber (`R6Combat` `windup`), hit-stop of
   70–80 ms even on a jab, and a one-frame impact flash or cone.

## 3. Spacing: which ease goes where

Roblox shapes the segment that **leaves** a key with that key's easing. Eclipse's exporter
interpolates segment [a, b] with a's key when it checks Roblox compatibility. `R6Clip:key(frame,
pose, ease)` follows the same rule.

| Segment | Ease | Why |
|---|---|---|
| guard → chamber (the load) | `sineInOut`, `quadIn` | the body gathers and accelerates into the load |
| chamber → contact (the strike) | `snap` (cubicOut), over 3–5 frames | leaves at full speed and brakes into the pose; over 1–2 frames any curve pops |
| contact → end of hold | `sineInOut`, with a few studs/degrees of creep | a hold that is alive, not a freeze |
| hold → guard (recovery, long) | `{ recover = 0.08–0.15 }` | eases out, drifts a little past guard, settles |
| short arrival (a reaction beat, a small adjust) | `{ settle = 0.1–0.2 }` | arrives at 20% of the segment, one bounce back |
| idle and breathing loops | `sineInOut` | a moving hold |
| a deliberate snap or step | `"constant"`, or bake `{ step = 5, stepped = true }` | the team's "on twos" house look: 12 poses a second, Constant easing |
| Eclipse's default curve | `smooth` = bezier (0.42, 0, 0.58, 1) | what an Eclipse user sees by default |

Roblox Pose easing has only Linear, Constant, Elastic, Cubic, Bounce and CubicV2. Moon Animator and
Eclipse **bake** anything richer into dense keys, and so does `R6Clip:bake()`: every frame, then
`R6Clip.reduce` drops keys that straight interpolation reproduces within 0.25°.

All 14 clips in the user's R6 movement system are baked this way: one key per 1/60 s, all Linear. Dense
Linear keys are the normal export of good R6 animation, not a smell. Legacy `Cubic` runs with In
and Out swapped, so use `CubicV2` when writing sparse keys.

## 4. Overlap and drag

- **The torso leads, the extremities trail.** Hips before chest, chest before arm, arm before fist
  (motion bible "drag / lag"; DevForum "the shoulder moves first and the arm lags behind").
- **Leads in the kit:**
  - attacks: `Torso +1`, the non-striking arm `−1`, `Head −2`
  - dashes: arms `−2`
  - idle: head `−4`, arms `−2/−3`
  - `R6Clip` extends the bake until trailing parts land.
- **The body keeps going after the fist stops.** The upper body lurches a frame or two past the
  arm's stop (DevForum R6 thread), then settles.
- **Delays must not add up.** If drag makes the fist late for the hit, the audit's contact check
  flags it.
- **The head counters, by hand.** Key `turn` at about −0.4 × the torso twist and ease off the nod,
  so the eyes stay on the target. The movement system takes back 35% of its sprint lunge at the neck. The
  hydraz run reference keeps the head level while the chest twists 30–45°. Never slide the head.
- **Springs give character.** Lightly underdamped head and waist (motion bible dials): bake the
  wobble into keys with a lead of −2 on the head, or a `settle` ease.

## 5. Holds, overshoot and settle

- **Overshoot 1.1–1.2×** past the pose on Hunter-style moves. Above 1.3 reads as cartoon (motion
  bible dials).
- **Settle 0.05–0.25** bounce. More than 0.5 is wobbly (motion bible).
- **Holds stay alive.** Creep a little toward the target (the bible's "attacker creep") or drift
  and breathe. A dead freeze reads as a stall or a network hitch.
- **Pose C.** A to B to C, never back to A. A recovery leans into the next move's wind-up, so the
  next press feels instant (bible "anticipation at the end").

## 6. Working the six-part body

- **The torso is the spine.** Twist it against the hips and lean it into the move. On a run, the
  chest twists 30–45° against the hips and the shoulder line rolls 15–20° (hydraz reference, motion
  bible). Stances turn the torso 70–90°.
- **Rotating the torso drags the legs,** because the legs are children of the Torso (DevForum),
  and a big twist swaps the hips front-to-back and crosses the legs. Hang the legs from the pelvis
  (`space = "root"`, `hips` 0.35) and ground them (`ground = true`): when the hips drop, the legs
  ride up into the torso, the movement system's way.
- **A foot passing under a lowered hip** (a step, a kick chamber) needs a passing key with the
  body risen. The leg has no knee to fold.
- **No elbows.** To suggest a bent elbow or a cocked fist, move the whole arm to where the forearm
  would be, and let the shoulder "detach" from the torso a little (DevForum R6 thread; the movement system's
  clips slide arms 0.15-0.9 stud). That slide is `pos` on the arm.
- **Treat the knee as if it sat at the hip** (DevForum). Small hops at the end of moves stand in
  for toes rising.
- **A sideways arm ignores raise.** At spread ≈ 90 the raise axis lies along the arm. Lift it with
  spread past 90 (the kit's hook uses 100).
- **Silhouette first.** Check every key pose from the play camera. The arms leave the body at
  60–90° from the sides (hydraz reference).
- **The Torso `pos` offset** (sink, lunge) must stay small, about a stud at most. The hitbox is the
  HumanoidRootPart, and a visual body far from it lies to the player.
- **Limb slides stay short.** Arms 1.0, legs 1.5, head 0.15 (`R6Rig.GAP`, audited).

## 7. Locomotion numbers (measured)

These come from the user's R6 movement system, measured offline.
The clips are baked at 60 fps, all Linear.

| Clip | Length | Key facts |
|---|---|---|
| idle v2 | 1.883 s, loop | tiny: legs splay 6–10°, head nod 1–3°, arms 2–7° |
| walk v3 | 0.833 s, loop | legs swing −35…+55°, arms ±20–29°, torso leans 8–11° and bobs 0.10–0.25 stud, head counter-rolls ±8° |
| run v4 | 0.633 s, loop | legs −58…+80°, arms −37…+122° (the forward arm swings high), torso leans 18–24°, rolls ±18°, bobs 0.25–0.34 stud, head counters ±18° |
| jump | 0.433 s | arms rise to 65°, torso pitches up to 17°, head 29° |
| fall | 1.35 s, loop | arms up 52–88°, legs paddling |
| Normal Land | 0.167 s | torso dips 15–33° forward and 0.32–0.39 stud down |
| Short / Long land | 0.467 / 0.667 s | big arm throw (to 104°), torso folds up to 42° / 57° |
| CrouchWalk | 1.2 s, loop | torso leans 37–45° |

Procedural numbers from the same system's turning, falling and animate scripts:
- **Lean by momentum.** Walk 0.020, sprint 0.007, crouch 0.025 rad per stud/s, blended at 4/s.
- **Sprint-start lunge.** 0.6 rad (34°) forward, decaying at 4/s. The neck takes back 35%.
- **Turning.** The hips yaw up to 40° toward a strafe and the torso counters.
- **Blend times by pair of clips:**
  - idle → walk 0.25 s, walk → idle 0.30 s
  - walk → run 0.18 s, run → walk 0.22 s
  - run → idle 0.30 s
- **Clip rate follows speed.** Walk plays at speed / 14.5, run at 1.3, and walking backwards plays
  the clip reversed.
- **Landing tiers by fall height:** under 4 studs normal, 4–15 short, over 15 long. Camera shake
  0.15 at 0.35 s for a short fall, 0.2 → 2.0 over 0.3 → 0.7 s for a long one.
- **The camera.** FOV 70 walk, 90 sprint, 62 crouch, 55 crawl, eased over 0.35–0.5 s. Bob 7 steps/s
  walking, 15 running. A 0.18-stud dip on landing.

Its limb slides, measured with `lune run study` (the house grammar, `reference-first.md` §5):
arms 0.15 idle → 0.4 walk → 0.7 run; legs ride 1.0-1.6 into the torso; the head never moves off
the neck.

Two runtime parts of that system are worth improving if a game copies them: its turning writes
`C0` every frame with a frame-rate *dependent* lerp (write `Motor6D.Transform` in PreSimulation
with `1 - exp(-rate·dt)` instead), and its "IK" hides the real legs and moves a cloned pair by
raycasts. This skill ships neither: clips play as authored.

## 8. Impact: hit-stop, reactions, camera, effects

- **Hit-stop.** 50–80 ms on light hits and 100–160 ms on heavy ones (motion bible). Both fighters
  freeze, the attacker lightly. Repay the freeze inside the drawn recovery, never on the server
  clock.
- **The victim starts displaced.** Frame 0 of a reaction is already the struck pose: no wind-up.
  In the Nullscript fight the victim is thrown back on the very next frame after contact, torso
  pitched back about 45°, head snapped. The hurt pose blends in over about 4 frames during the
  freeze (motion bible).
- **Reactions cut in hard** (fade 0). Hits start hard. Only the way *out* of a move blends
  (0.1–0.15 s).
- **Camera.** Shake on impact, but not on every hit, or nothing reads as big.
  - Nullscript cuts to a close-up on a fist clash and holds it about 0.5 s.
  - Hovark (TikTok) flashes a blank frame, then cuts to a near-POV angle at contact, with tilted
    (dutch) angles on aerials.
  - FOV kicks on dashes (movement system, DevForum).
- **Effects meet the motion, never bury it:**
  - a one-frame impact star at contact, with radial speed lines (Nullscript)
  - white arc trails on swings
  - 2D swirl or wind lines held about 0.25 s around a landed kick (Hovark)
  - smear frames only on the fastest strike frames
  - trails never run through the wind-up (motion bible)

## 9. The anti-plastic checklist

Run it on every clip, by eye in `preview.html` at 1× and 0.25×, and with `R6Clip.audit`:

- [ ] Brief written: weight, striking limb, what reads first, keywords.
- [ ] Load opposite the strike. The torso twists through the hit in the right direction
  (orthodox: jab and lead hook clockwise, cross and uppercut counter-clockwise).
- [ ] A reference found and measured (`reference-first.md`), or the fallback to the house grammar
  said out loud.
- [ ] Hit at 20–50%, strike over 3–5 frames, contact held 4–6 frames with a little creep.
- [ ] The body commits: torso turned 40+ into a straight punch, a lunge, the fist 2.8+ studs out.
- [ ] Ease per segment (section 3). No linear-everywhere, no ease-in-out on the strike.
- [ ] Leads and trails set: torso first, head and free arm behind.
- [ ] Feet on the floor during grounded moves (the audit's dig and hover are both near 0), legs
  never crossed (no `legs:` note).
- [ ] The recovery overshoots guard a touch and settles. The next move can start from it.
- [ ] Slides short and along the motion (no `gap:` note); the head only rotates.
- [ ] The striking limb lands on the target's centre line.
- [ ] No HumanoidRootPart keys. Travel is physics (`R6Combat` dash burst).
- [ ] Priorities are correct (idle < movement < action < block < reaction) and no two clips share
  a priority on the same joints at once.
- [ ] Audit clean, and seen from the side and from the front.

## 10. Learning from other clips

`lune run study <file>` (or `R6Study.measure` in Studio) prints the R6 numbers that matter for
imitation: timing, the strike line, torso drop/lunge/lean, every part's rotation reach and socket
slide. `Sequence.analyze(Sequence.read(ks))` adds, per part, travel, peak speed and holds, for any
rig (R15 too). The full method is `reference-first.md`.

To study a clip you like:
- Measure where its peak speed falls (the strike).
- Count its holds and see how far the torso turns against the legs.
- Copy the *proportions*, not the keys.

For R15 sources, convert first (`r15-to-r6.md`) and measure both sides. The convert tool prints
them.
